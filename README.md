# spring-boot-ws-app
ongoing project of spring cloud , spring config , and spring security  

the idea behind this project is to implement a ws architecture working with micro services and to have the config service include a messaging broker in this case i tried to use RabitMQ 
this is an incomplet project , wich was a use case to train and learn new things.
